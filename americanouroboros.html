          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>For the few people who I have shared this with, you likely know me from one of many spheres in which I work or live. So, to those who've met me in a context unrelated, dealing in international politics has been a 'necessary evil' at times in my life for many reasons. </p>
          </div>
         
         <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>The following is my own contextualization, in the tradition of the 'grand narrative', of where we are and how we got here based on (admittedly) privileged conversations I've had with friends and mentors, from heads of global banking houses to long-range geostrategic planners at the Pentagon, to venture capital funds, etc. Throughout this, I acknowledge the intrinsic privilege of proximity to wealth, power, and information. The question then is <i>'what is the good I can do with it?'</i></p>
         </div>

         <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>My response to that being, maybe my read on things can help illuminate some small part of an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
         </div>
         
         <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Good. Now that that's out of the way, let's enter the twilight zone, yes?</p>
         </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <h2>1.1 Buckets</h2>

          <p>But first, an experiment.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Want to know a secret?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>I'm going to attempt to disarm you.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Now, I know telling you somewhat defeats the purpose of a secret, but I figure you should at least be somewhat aware. I'm going to attempt to disarm you, intellectually. Strip you down. Break your mind in a sense. Or, at the very least, bend it a little. Why? Because it's the only way to get through this weird portal we're about to go through. Consider this... practice.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">For background, a while ago I had a chat with Jamie Dimon at an event. One thing he said stuck with me:
            
        <p><i>"Intellectually, using a baseline in your thinking and analysis is a bad idea."</i></p>
       
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">     
          <p>While I don't often share takes with Dimon, what he said reminded me of a formative concept I learned at Stanford which was to avoid getting stuck in buckets.</p></div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Let's say I'm trying to impress you with how fast I can run a mile. How fast would I have to run to be considered impressive?
            If you said under four minutes, you're about right. You have a category for that. You have a baseline. This is a common strategy that our brains use to make sense of the world. We form schemas. We take things that are continua and break them up into categories, in this case: a range of time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Now, say I'm trying to impress you with my painting skills and I tell you I'm such an impressive painter because I can paint with 11 different colors.
            Ah, now that doesn't work, does it? Because that's not a category. There's no <i>bucket</i> for that. We don't categorize how good a painter someone is based on how many colors they use. Ok, stay with me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>I'm going to give you a number series and I want you to tell me what comes next: 4, 14, 23, 34, ...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p>Take a second. I mean it. Really analyze it. What's the next number?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>
            No? Nothing? OK.
            What about now: 4th, 14th, 23rd, 34th, ...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>
            Is it clearer?  Did you get it?
            The next one in the sequence is...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">

        </div>
        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>...that's right: 42nd.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          If you're a New Yorker this was likely apparent to you much sooner than if you weren't. Why? Because if you're from New York you have a specific <i>category</i> for this number sequence: subway stops. You have a mental schema, a set of categories for viewing the world that is different from someone who doesn't live in New York.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Now vice versa: If you <i>don't</i> have that subway schema in mind chances are you were thinking logically. Maybe doing some sort of math to deduce what was next, maybe calculating prime numbers and Fibonacci series' and whatnot.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>But here we run into the first problem of categorical thinking. If you think in categories, you are in danger of missing the bigger picture. You corral yourself into a bucket and you might not even realize it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Well, again, so what? Who cares? What damage can this do?</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Let me read you a few quotes from people who were living in their own buckets, thinking and living in categories, pathologically sticking to their baselines. Let me illustrate the danger of buckets. </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>First quote:</p>
        </div>
        
        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p><i><b>"Give me a child at birth from any background, and let me control the total environment in which he is raised, and I will turn him into anything I wish him to be-- whether doctor, lawyer, or beggar, or thief."</i></b></p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>That was, as you might have guessed, John Watson. One of the founders of the school of psychology called behaviorism. He espoused this notion that if we control the mechanisms of reward and punishment, we can turn anybody into the kind of person we want. Of course, nowadays we know this isn't true! Throw a little protein malnutrition into the equation and the notion quickly crumbles.</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Next quote.</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p><i><b>"Normal psychic life depends on the good functioning of brain synapses, and mental disorders appear as a result of the synaptic derangements. Synaptic adjustments will then modify the corresponding ideas and force them into different channels. Using this approach, we obtained cures and improvements but no failures..."</b></i></p>
        </div>

        <br>


        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p>Let's pause here. Synaptic adjustments. What do you think those little synaptic adjustments were?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Any guesses? Electroshock?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Yeah, you wish it were that gentle. If you guessed frontal lobotomies, you were right! This was Egas Moniz, upon recieving the Nobel Prize, a Portuguese neurologist who invented frontal lobotomies. This practice was something that precipitated through the medical community and was done to hundreds of thousands of people who had nothing wrong with them, the criminal destruction of people's brains once again illustrating the real world dangers of thinking pathologically in buckets and how things that, in retrospect, seem unimaginably horrific can come to pass by doing so.</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Ok. Final quote. Worst one of the three.</p>
        </div>

        <br> 

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <i><b>"The selection for social utility must be accomplished by some social institution if mankind is not to be ruined by domestication induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect. We may, and we must, rely on the healthy instincts of the best of our people for the extermination of elements of the population loaded with dregs."</i></b></p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
          <p>Any guesses? No, it's not Hitler - but close. This was instead one of Hitler's main scientific propagandists, Konrad Lorenz, which you may have learned about in school, otherwise known as the one of the fathers of ethology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p>Credited with having discovered imprinting behavior in animals, he was often portrayed as an adorable little Austrian guy, little ducklings following him around and it's oh-so-cute -- and he was also a rabid Nazi who went to his grave thinking he had done nothing wrong in promoting the genocide of millions of people, those 'dregs' of the population that he spoke of.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p>These are not fringe individuals on a random podcast, these are not simple conspiratorial pseudointellectuals. These are people who altered the course of human history and thought. These are people whose categorical thinking shaped scientific fields - and led to some of the darkest periods of human history.</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="fade-in-section">
        <p>All this to illustrate that, as we navigate an uncertain new world, we must similarly avoid getting stuck in categorical thinking, else we risk being pulled towards those problems we just saw. We must avoid overestimating the importance of the bucket we live in, the lens that we use to see the world, the baseline that we have built - our survival and that of our species might depend on it.</p>
