            It's been a while, hasn't it?
            </p>
            
            <p>I'm distant from everyone again. I'm popping modafinil again.
            </p>
          <p>
            I know, I know. I know. Not good.</p> <p> Old habits have a way of greeting me like old friends - little white flags of surrender swallowed with mineral water between swirls of turbulence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My throat is perpetually dry from flights into strange time zones. The past couple of weeks have been a blur. I miss home. I miss many things. I'm writing to you from a boardroom where I'll be seeing Uli for the first time since Art Basel, he's the one to thank for the rides to and from hotels these past few weeks. If I hadn't run into his daughter in St. Moritz I'd probably have spent a small fortune on Ubers and Addison Lee's by now. Turns out we have mutuals, I guess. I blame the serendipity of the apres-ski crowd.</p>
            <p>Sam arrived today. We talked about DACA over coffee and he tells me about his newborn. He's one of the good ones. Though I wonder - what does it feel like to be a father in this kind of world?</p>

            <p>I feel like I'm losing my soul these days.
            A friend told me she kneeled in a cathedral, hair covered in a silk veil, to pray for me the other day.<br>Another friend said they'd read my heart in a tarot deck, glyphs spread across black marble and noble silver somewhere in the Cotswolds.<br>Yet another friend texted me to tell me that they'd recited a protection spell under moonlight - under burning mountain sage and crushed sea salt. I was given instructions each time, all eerily similar. Bow my head and say the name seven times, light the myhrr and say a prayer.</p>
  
            <p>I tend to have more questions than answers these days, a new world is emerging. I'll write that one soon, I suppose. <br> I guess you probably have more questions than answers too. Maybe someday I'll answer them all but for now all I'd like to know is how long before a soul can't be kept whole anymore? How far is too far in a holy war?</p>
