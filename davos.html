          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Eventually the serpent catches its tail.</p>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>I think that's the moral of the story here.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>There is a saying by Lenin that deftly encapsulates what many people have felt in the past month (for his affinity of civilian executions, the guy cooked with this one): </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p><i>"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.”</p></i> 
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section"><p>If that sentiment would have seemed a bit esoteric before, it certainly seems much easier to grasp now. Let me take you through my point of view, starting from inauguration day.</p></div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>It was in Davos that the feeling of uneasiness first set in, for me at least. The World Economic Forum was set to open the same week as inauguration day and the attending corporate chiefs, financiers, analysts, and politicos were already adjusting sail. The question that seemed to linger, even if it were not being overtly asked, was: <i>'What does Trump 2.0 mean for the global business community?'</i></p>
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section"><p>I'm sure painkiller stock was dangerously low throughout the promenade because there was a fair amount of fencesitting that week.
       Absent was the shock and gloom of the 2016 election. The messaging from the international business community was essentially 'business as usual'. Trump had won before and the world had survived, hadn't it? We elect bad leaders all the time. Chaotic leaders. We'll be <i>fine.</i></p></div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>The execs of Pfizer, Uber, etc; leaders from Saudi, the Emiratis, the Ukrainians (Zelensky, et al) - all maintained diplomatic composure and spoke about looking forward to working with the incoming administration in a way that suggested continuing along the same path. The messaging was that it is better to engage rather than walk away - a point with which I initially resisted but now agree with. The tricky part is figuring out <i>how</i> to engage. One does what one must, I suppose. Working with unsavory or hostile parties is often necessary in human governance. In a globalized world there is always room for dessert - and realpolitik.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Still, the shadow of an increasingly isolated United States was obvious throughtout. Much of the American C-suite coterie was absent. A clear signal that US industry leaders, markedly tech execs, were embracing the incoming administration's 'America First' sentiment. <i>Note: this has become even more apparent as of late. See Bezos and the Washington Post decree.</i></p>
          </div>

          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Overall, the outlook towards the next Trump presidency was positive and though bothered by this, I recognize that Davos is an economic affair and I make no illusions of it being a human rights forum. The après-ski crowd in St. Moritz is hardly an arbiter of social good. All things considered, it is a fair barometer in regards to the outlook on global trade and finance and by any measure the old guard seemed ready to play ball, to embrace a Trump administration that would roll back regulation, ease taxes on corporations, etc. The takeaway, prima facie: 'let the good times roll.'
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fade-in-section">
            <p>Fast forward to the first couple of months of this administration and it's obvious that this is anything but 'business as usual' for the United States and allies. But how did we get here? </p>
